# Aldryn Categories

## Project Goals

1. Provide a heirarchical categorizing capability that could be used to tag arbitrary
   content throughout a project with a common set of categories.
2. Categories should be Internationalisable.
3. Should be largely compatible with (but decoupled from) django-taggit.
4. Should be extensible: possible to extend the base tag/category model to add arbitrary
   fields/methods.

### Dependencies/Support

1. Python v2.7+
2. Django v1.6+
3. django-treebeard v2.0+
